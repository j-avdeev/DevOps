.. rubric:: **Motivation**
   :name: h-motivation

CI/CD is a technique for delivering apps to customers,
achieved by adding automation to different stages of
app development. I believe that grasping CI/CD
(Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) can
empower developers to gain a better understanding of
how backend project artifacts exist beyond the
boundaries of the project repository. This
comprehension can also create a fundamental shift in a
developer's perspective. Instead of merely viewing
their work as lines of code, they can start to embrace
the broader context of their project as a valuable
product.


In this article, we aim to demystify the CI/CD process
through practical application. We'll take you through
a step-by-step tutorial, breaking it down module by
module, where you'll build a CI/CD pipeline manually.
To do this, we'll harness the power of contemporary
DevOps tools like **AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible,
Git, Apache Maven,** and **Jenkins**. So, let's begin
this journey!


.. rubric:: **[Module 1]: AWS EC2 Virtual Server**
   :name: h-module-1-aws-ec-2-virtual-server

This module is dedicated to the creation of an AWS EC2
Virtual Server instance. As part of this article, you
will be setting up three EC2 instances for Jenkins,
Ansible, and Kubernetes. For now, you can proceed with
the next modules and revisit this module in "[module
2]: Jenkins", “[module 6]: Ansible" and "[module 7]:
Kubernetes" sections.

.. rubric:: **[Module 2]: Jenkins Server**
   :name: h-module-2-jenkins-server

Now, let’s configure JenkinsServer on the EC2 Virtual
Server instance.

.. rubric:: **Step 1: Create an AWS EC2 Virtual Server
   instance**
   :name: h-step-1-create-an-aws-ec-2-virtual-server-instance

You need a virtual server to run Jenkins.

Follow instructions from **[Module 1]: AWS EC2 Virtual
Server** section of this tutorial to finish this step
and create an EC2 virtual server instance with the
name JenkinsServer.

.. warning::
   Do not forget to add a security group setup. It
   allows **Jenkins** and **SSH** to work on
   port **8080** and **22** respectively.

.. note::
   Use the name **“JenkinsServer”** to distinguish
   your EC2 Virtual Server instance.

.. note::
   Create **“CI_CD_Pipeline”** security group
   and **“CI_CD_Pipeline_Key_Pair“** for a
   new **“JenkinsServer”** AWS EC2 instance. You can
   reuse them further in the article.

.. rubric:: **Step 2: Connect to an AWS EC2 Virtual
   Server instance**
   :name: h-step-2-connect-to-an-aws-ec-2-virtual-server-instance

Go to **AWS Console home page** → **EC2 Management
Console Dashboard** → **Instances.**

Then you should choose **JenkinsServer** and then
click the **“Connect”** button.

.. rubric:: **Step 3: Download the Jenkins
   repository**
   :name: h-step-3-download-the-jenkins-repository

Now you need to download Jenkins on your EC2 virtual
server instance.

Follow these instructions:

#. Go to Jenkins
   download `webpage <https://www.jenkins.io/download>`__.

#. You can see Stable (LTS) and Regular releases
   (Weekly) options. Choose `Red
   Hat/Fedora/Alma/Rocky/CentOS <https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable>`__\ LTS
   option.

You will see this web page.

.. figure:: media/CICD-by-Zufar/CICD-by-Zufar-24.png

    The screenshot of Jenkins download web page

3. Copy **“sudo get..”** command and execute it to
   download Jenkins files from the Jenkins repository
   on the Internet and save them to the specified
   location on your EC2 virtual server instance.

.. code:: bash

   sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

Now Jenkins is downloaded.


.. rubric:: **Step 4: Import Jenkins key**
   :name: h-step-4-import-jenkins-key

To finish the Jenkins installation, we need to import
the Jenkins key.

To import the Jenkins key we need to copy the **“sudo
rpm..”** command and execute it.

.. code:: bash

   sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

.. container:: notice notice-info

   This way **“rpm”** package manager can verify that
   the Jenkins packages you install are exactly the
   ones published by the Jenkins project, and that
   they haven't been tampered with or corrupted.

.. rubric:: **Step 5: Install Java**
   :name: h-step-5-install-java

To run Jenkins, we need to install **Java** on our EC2
virtual server instance.

To install **Java**, use this command.

| 

.. code:: bash

   sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

| 

Verify whether
**Java**
was installed correctly using this command:

.. code:: bash

   java -version

You will see something like that.

    The screenshot of AWS EC2 Virtual Server instance
    online terminal with installed JDK 11

.. rubric:: **Step 6: Install fontconfig**
   :name: h-step-6-install-fontconfig

To run Jenkins, you need to install **fontconfig** on
our EC2 virtual server instance.

Use this command.

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum install fontconfig java-11-openjdk -y

.. note::

   Fontconfig is a library designed to provide
   system-wide font configuration, customization and
   application access. It's required by Jenkins
   because Jenkins has features that render fonts.

.. rubric:: **Step 7: Install Jenkins**
   :name: h-step-7-install-jenkins

In earlier steps, you configured your EC2 virtual
server instance to use a specific Jenkins repository
and then you imported the GPG key associated with this
repository. Now, you need to run the command that will
search all the repositories it knows about, including
the Jenkins one you added, to find the Jenkins
package. Once it finds the Jenkins package in the
Jenkins repository, it will download and install it.

Let’s run this command.

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum install jenkins -y

.. rubric:: **Step 8: Start Jenkins**
   :name: h-step-8-start-jenkins

You can start Jenkins using this command.

.. code:: bash

   sudo systemctl start jenkins

To check that Jenkins is running use this command.

.. code:: bash

   sudo systemctl status jenkins

You will see the output as it is on the screenshot
below:

.. figure:: media/CICD-by-Zufar/CICD-by-Zufar-26.png
    :scale: 50 %

    The screenshot of AWS EC2 Virtual Server instance
    online terminal with installed Jenkins

Jenkins should now be up and running.

.. rubric:: **Step 9: Access Jenkins**
   :name: h-step-9-access-jenkins

To access the Jenkins application, open any web
browser and enter your EC2 instance’s public IP
address or domain name followed by port 8080.

.. code:: bash

   http://<your-ec2-ip>:8080

.. warning::
   If you care about security, change your admin's
   password after all interaction with Jenkins via
   http.

   Using ssh, paste into <passwordHash> element at
   /var/lib/jenkins/users/<username>/config.xml
   something of type #jbcrypt:hash.

   Example for password test:

     <passwordHash>#jbcrypt:$2a$10$razd3L1aXndFfBNHO95aj.IVrFydsxkcQCcLmujmFQzll3hcUrY7S</passwordHash>

   Restart Jenkins, then try logging in with password test.
   And then reset your password to something else.

   For hash-making you can use any online bcrypt encoder.

The first time you access Jenkins, it will be locked
with an autogenerated password.

.. figure:: media/CICD-by-Zufar/CICD-by-Zufar-27.png
    :scale: 50 %

    The screenshot of Jenkins installed on AWS EC2
    Virtual Server with the pointer to Administrator
    password

You need to display this password using the following
command.

.. code:: bash

   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy this password, return to your browser, paste it
into the Administrator password field, and click
"Continue".

Then you will be able to see this web page.

    Jenkins" web page

Now, you can use your Jenkins Server.

.. rubric:: **Step 10: Create new Jenkins pipeline**
   :name: h-step-10-create-new-jenkins-pipeline

Now, as Jenkins is working fine, you can start
creating the Jenkins pipeline. To create Jenkins
pipeline you need to create a new “Freestyle project”.
To create a new “Freestyle project” you need to go to
the Jenkins dashboard and click the **“New
Item”** button.

.. figure:: media/CICD-by-Zufar/CICD-by-Zufar-29.png
    :scale: 50 %

Then click the button “Apply” and “Save”. After that,
it means you created the fundament of the pipeline
which is going to be built in this tutorial.

.. rubric:: **[Module 3]: Git and Github**
   :name: h-module-3-git-and-github

Now as Jenkins is running on AWS EC2 Virtual Server
instance, you can configure Git with the pipeline.

.. container:: notice notice-info

   Git is a `free and open
   source <https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source>`__ distributed
   version control system (VCS) designed to help
   software teams keep track of every modification to
   the code in a special kind of database. If a
   mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock
   and compare earlier versions of the code to help
   fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all
   team members. VCS is especially useful
   for `DevOps <https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops>`__ teams
   since they help them to reduce development time and
   increase successful deployments [1].

Git as the most popular version control system enables
us to pull the latest code from your project Github
repository to your EC2 virtual server instance where
your Jenkins is installed.

.. rubric:: **Step 1: Install Git**
   :name: h-step-1-install-git

Use this command to install Git.

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum install git -y

Now verify Git is working, using this command.

.. code:: bash

   git --version

Now Git is working fine on EC2 Virtual Server
instance.

.. rubric:: **Step 2: Open Jenkins dashboard**
   :name: h-step-2-open-jenkins-dashboard

As Git is working fine on EC2 Virtual Server instance,
we can integrate Jenkins with Git now.

To start this integration let’s install Jenkins Github
plugin.

Go to Jenkins dashboard section.

Here, you have finished configuring the Jenkins Github
plugin.

.. rubric:: **Step 7: Integrate Git into the
   pipeline**
   :name: h-step-7-integrate-git-into-the-pipeline

Now, as the Jenkins Github plugin is installed and
configured, you're now able to utilize this plugin
within your pipeline. This will allow your pipeline
which you created in module 2 to pull your project
code from the specified GitHub repository.

Well, to integrate this plugin into your pipeline you
need to go to the Source Code Management section and
choose Git in your pipeline. Then you need to provide
your project repository URL. If your project
repository is public on Github, you do not need to
provide credentials. If the project repository is
private on Github, you need to provide credentials.

.. figure:: media/CICD-by-Zufar/CICD-by-Zufar-41.png

.. rubric:: **[Module 4]: Apache Maven**
   :name: h-module-4-apache-maven

.. note::

   **Apache Maven** is a widely used build automation
   and project management tool in software
   development. It streamlines the process of
   compiling, testing, and packaging code by managing
   project dependencies and providing a consistent
   build lifecycle. Maven employs XML-based
   configuration files (POM files) to define project
   structure, dependencies, and tasks, enabling
   developers to efficiently manage and deploy complex
   software projects.

Now that you have integrated Git into the pipeline,
you can enhance the pipeline further by incorporating
Apache Maven which enables you to build, test, and
package your project. To do that you need to install
Apache Maven on your AWS EC2 Virtual Server instance
where Jenkins and Git were installed.

.. rubric:: **Step 1: Download Apache Maven**
   :name: h-step-1-download-apache-maven

To download Apache Maven go to the
**“/opt”** directory.
